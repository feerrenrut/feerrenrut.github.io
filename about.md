*[Perth]: Perth, Western Australia

Reef Turner is a Software Engineer from Perth who describes himself in the
third person. Reef likes to hack on all the latest technologies
with the other cool kids. Although most of his experience is in C++ and C#, he
has an interest in all things software.

Outside of his time working on software, Reef plays music in a band (perhaps
you will catch a gig?) and enjoys surfing at local (and not so local) breaks.
